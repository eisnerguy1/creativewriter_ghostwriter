    Microsoft Canada has entered into a development and publishing agreement with Children’s Television Workshop to develop software that uses characters from the latter’s Ghostwriter tv series.
<br><br>
On Nov. 1, the first Creative Writer/Ghostwriter package for children will be available, The Case of the Blue Makava.
<br><br>
The package works on either the floppy-disked version of Creative Writer or on the cd-rom version.
